This is a fork of [superdeno](https://github.com/cmorten/superdeno#api) with the changes necessary for Deno 2.0 based off of https://github.com/cmorten/superdeno/pull/45. However that PR has been in limbo for a while due to being unable to properly run tests due to further dependencies not supporting Deno 2. So while this fork should support Deno 2 there is no guarantee that everything works due to not having the tests.
